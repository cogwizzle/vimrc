= Redbean =
== Overview ==
Redbean is a really fast ORM that is used for small to medium sized projects in PHP.  It is a little bit quirky, but it is fast and easy to learn.

== Quirks ==
=== Models ===
Redbean Models don't exactly focus on the structure of the object rather what is required for the bean to be complete.  The update function is where you can reject a bean if it does not contain the required information.

Example of udpate function.
{{{
  public function update(){
    if(!isset($this->bean->property)){
      throw new Exception("Property must be set");
    }
  }
}}}

Models can also be used to automatically append relationships to a bean.  This is done through the open function.

Example of the open function.
{{{
  public function open(){
    $this->bean->sharedProperty;
    $this->bean->ownAttribute;
  }
}}}

Model definitions must extend *Redbean_SimpleModel*.

=== Freeze ===
Redbean has the ability to dynamically create database tables.  Through the freeze function Redbean can define the database as complete.

{{{
  R::freeze(true);
}}}

Freezing the database makes the queries a little bit faster.  Additionally a developer can speed up the queries a bit more by adding the schema to the Redbean instance.

{{{
  $schema = R::getDuplicationManager()->getSchema();
  R::getDuplicationManager()->setTables($schema);
}}}
